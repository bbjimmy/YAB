  BUTTON IMAGE images, use DRAW IMAGE instead!
  Note: currently untested in Haiku
  Error codes for PrintingError:
    0 = No Problems
    1 = Page setup failed (probably communication problems with the print server)
    2 = The configuration file was loaded but page setup failed
    3 = The view View$ was not found
    4 = The number of pages is 0 or less
    5 = The printing was canceled or something went wrong with printing
  Note: PrintingError = 4 can happen because of a bug in the PDF printing driver; although
  a page size is shown, none is selected. If this happens, you may want to call a PRINTER SETUP
  for the user and try to print again.
  Note: When an error with code 1,2,3 or 4 occurs, you can be shure that nothing was sent to the printer yet.
