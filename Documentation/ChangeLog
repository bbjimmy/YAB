yab Version 1.6 Changes from Version 1.5

- CALENDAR look updated to Haiku style and code refactored
- TABVIEW look updated to Haiku style

  resolves the race condition bug (this should also resolve the hanging
  BuildFactory, thx to clasqm for reporting)
- using "copy" for an empty selection in TEXTEDIT does not clear the 
  clipboard anymore (thx to streakx for reporting)
- Haiku forced a minimum button height, yab does not like force (thx to 
  Lelldorin for reporting)
- Title in BOXVIEW is now shown correctly (thx to Lelldorin for reporting)
- Window flags don't reset anymore after calling WINDOW SET (thx to clasqm 
  for reporting)

Known problems:
- Tooltips cannot be unset, they cannot change color, they steal focus (fixed on
  new Haiku builds), they suck (blame the Haiku team ;))
- Tooltips do not work for all Widgets
- Spincontrol cannot move shift-tab backwards

Other Fixes (1.6):
- Scrolling in the yab IDE works again with new Haiku builds (the bug in Haiku
  got fixed, thx to leszek for reporting, thx for zooey for fixing)
